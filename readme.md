# Impact of Air Pollution on Public Health

This project investigates how air pollution affects public health across major global cities.  
Using **2024 air quality data** combined with health impact indicators, the study analyzes pollutant levels, visualizes patterns, and applies **machine learning** to predict health outcomes.  
The goal is to identify the cities and pollutants most strongly linked to **respiratory, cardiovascular, and hospital-related health risks**, providing insights that could inform future policy and public health decisions.

## üìä Project Overview
- **Pollutants analyzed:** PM2.5, PM10, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, CO, O‚ÇÉ  
- **Weather factors included:** Temperature, humidity, wind speed  
- **Health outcomes predicted:**  
  - Respiratory cases  
  - Cardiovascular cases  
  - Hospital admissions  

- **Techniques used:**  
  - Data cleaning & preprocessing  
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
  - Correlation analysis (Pearson, Spearman)  
  - Random Forest Regression models  
  - Health Burden Index (HBI) development  

---

## üìà Key Results
- **Paris, Tokyo, S√£o Paulo, and Sydney** ranked among the highest for pollution-linked health burden.  
- **PM2.5 and NO‚ÇÇ** emerged as dominant contributors to health risks.  
- **O‚ÇÉ (ozone)** also proved highly influential in driving respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes.  
- The **Health Burden Index (HBI)** provided a composite ranking of cities, with **Paris** topping hospital admissions and overall health burden.
